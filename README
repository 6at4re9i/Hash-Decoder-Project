Hello!
This is my first project on git, so maybe it's a little rude or somethnig, but i'm proud of it.
I hope it will help you to solve your problems.

How is it works:
  first:
    you need to choose the length, of hashed password
  second:
    you need to choose the kind of symbols, used in the pass
    
    ****i hope i dont need to explain algorithms of choose****
    
    then you enter your hash
    
    the programm will create every single combination of every single choosen symbol
    then passwords will be hashed
    the hashed password cimparing with your entered hash and then there is two paths:
        1.they will be equal, and horey, we found your pass!
        
        2.brute force will continue
        
        
        it's not very fast, but if you know how to boost this code - do it.
